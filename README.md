# Human-in-the-loop-Intrusion_Detection
Put all the files in Google Drive
Create a Folder in Home Directory names 'threat_detection' and put all the '.py' inside it and then open the .ipynb file here named 'colab_ml_loop'
Use Kali Linux for detection to happen cause one side has gotta attack the other for Detection to take place
Use 2 VM's both configured to Host-Only Network
Then carry out some attacks from the attacker vm on the victim vm
When you have run the 'web_ui.py', you'll get an ip from it, run that ip in a website after you've carried out attacks to see the attacks which the machine can't handle displayed there, just select the appropriate options and send it to update the dataset and run the colab code again
